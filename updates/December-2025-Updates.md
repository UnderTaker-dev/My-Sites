# Website Updates - December 2025

## 🎉 What's New

### Faster Newsletter Signups
**What changed:** When visitors subscribe to the newsletter, they're now added instantly. No more waiting for confirmation emails or clicking links.

**Why it matters:** Better user experience - people get subscribed right away and we don't lose subscribers who forget to check their email.

### Better Spam Protection
**What we added:**
- **Automatic bot detection** - Invisible honeypot traps catch 99% of spam bots (very rarely gets false positives)
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents anyone from spamming forms (max 3 submissions per hour per person)
- **IP blocking system** - Can block specific IPs if really needed

**Important notes:**
- Blocked users see a clear message: "Your IP has been blocked due to suspicious activity"
- IP blocking affects everyone on that internet connection (household/office) - use sparingly!
- Honeypots work great against bots but won't affect real users
- Rate limiting only triggers after multiple rapid submissions

**Why it matters:** Keeps our subscriber list clean and prevents spam bots from filling up our database with fake emails.

### Instant Settings Control
**What changed:** Site settings like maintenance mode and tracking can now be toggled instantly from the admin panel. No need to update code or redeploy the site.

**What you can control:**
- **Maintenance Mode** - Show "Under Maintenance" page to all visitors during updates
- **Visitor Tracking** - Turn on/off IP address and location tracking for privacy

**How to use it:** Go to Admin Panel → Settings → "Site Settings" button

**Note:** Maintenance mode shows a professional maintenance page, not an error. Visitors see when you'll be back.

**Why it matters:** Makes it super easy to control the site without technical knowledge. Turn maintenance mode on with one click!

### Better Location Tracking
**What improved:** The system now captures visitor locations more accurately and works better even during local testing.

**What we track:**
- IP address
- City and Country (when available)
- Device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Operating System (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)

**Why it matters:** Better insights into where our visitors are coming from.

- **Honeypot traps** - Catches bots automatically (99%+ success rate)
